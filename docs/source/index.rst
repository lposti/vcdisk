Rotation curves of thick galaxy disks
=====================================================
This is a minimal python package to solve Poisson's equation and to compute the
circular velocity curve of a truncated disk with non-zero thickness and arbitrary
radial density profile. This implements the algorithm of Casertano (1983 [1]_).

The package can be installed using

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install vcdisk
